The scaling factors used for the MS COCO datasets are smaller than the scaling factors used for the Pascal VOC datasets.

    "The code cells below set up the data generators for the training and validation datasets to train the model. The settings below reproduce the original SSD training on Pascal VOC 2007 `trainval` plus 2012 `trainval` and validation on Pascal VOC 2007 `test`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only thing you need to change here are the filepaths to the datasets on your local machine. Note that parsing the labels from the XML annotations files can take a while.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the generator provides two options to speed up the training. By default, it loads the individual images for a batch from disk. This has two disadvantages. First, for compressed image formats like JPG, this is a huge computational waste, because every image needs to be decompressed again and again every time it is being loaded. Second, the images on disk are likely not stored in a contiguous block of memory, which may also slow down the loading process. The first option that `DataGenerator` provides to deal with this is to load the entire dataset into memory, which reduces the access time for any image to a negligible amount, but of course this is only an option if you have enough free memory to hold the whole dataset. As a second option, `DataGenerator` provides the possibility to convert the dataset into a single HDF5 file. This HDF5 file stores the images as uncompressed arrays in a contiguous block of memory, which dramatically speeds up the loading time. It's not as good as having the images in memory, but it's a lot better than the default option of loading them from their compressed JPG state every time they are needed. Of course such an HDF5 dataset may require significantly more disk space than the compressed images (around 9 GB total for Pascal VOC 2007 `trainval` plus 2012 `trainval` and another 2.6 GB for 2007 `test`). You can later load these HDF5 datasets directly in the constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original SSD implementation uses a batch size of 32 for the training. In case you run into GPU memory issues, reduce the batch size accordingly. You need at least 7 GB of free GPU memory to train an SSD300 with 20 object classes with a batch size of 32.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `DataGenerator` itself is fairly generic. It doesn't contain any data augmentation or bounding box encoding logic. Instead, you pass a list of image transformations and an encoder for the bounding boxes in the `transformations` and `label_encoder` arguments of the data generator's `generate()` method, and the data generator will then apply those given transformations and the encoding to the data. Everything here is preset already, but if you'd like to learn more about the data generator and its data augmentation capabilities, take a look at the detailed tutorial in [this](https://github.com/pierluigiferrari/data_generator_object_detection_2d) repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data augmentation settings defined further down reproduce the data augmentation pipeline of the original SSD training. The training generator receives an object `ssd_data_augmentation`, which is a transformation object that is itself composed of a whole chain of transformations that replicate the data augmentation procedure used to train the original Caffe implementation. The validation generator receives an object `resize`, which simply resizes the input images.\n",
    "\n",
    "An `SSDInputEncoder` object, `ssd_input_encoder`, is passed to both the training and validation generators. As explained above, it matches the ground truth labels to the model's anchor boxes and encodes the box coordinates into the format that the model needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to train the model on a dataset other than Pascal VOC, either choose `DataGenerator`'s appropriate parser method that corresponds to your data format, or, if `DataGenerator` does not provide a suitable parser for your data format, you can write an additional parser and add it. Out of the box, `DataGenerator` can handle datasets that use the Pascal VOC format (use `parse_xml()`), the MS COCO format (use `parse_json()`) and a wide range of CSV formats (use `parse_csv()`)."
